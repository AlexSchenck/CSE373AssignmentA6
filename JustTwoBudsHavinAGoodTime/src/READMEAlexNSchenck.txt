4. Both of us set up a private GitHub repository and our Eclipse environment. Some code would be done concurrently, while other sections were done by one person with the collaboration of the other looking on. Both of us attended Wednesday office hours and took notes. I was the driving force behind the Vertex class, retrievePath, and overall commenting, while Harry developed the larger part of both bfs and dfs, along with the edge class and retrievePath.
5. To me, the most important thing I learned was how to traverse and search a graph. Until this point, I was only familiar with searching trees, but now I have experience in implicit graphs. This project was not quite a learning experience in teamwork, as Harry was a strong and efficient partner.
6. Assignment was not turned in late
